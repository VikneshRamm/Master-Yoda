# Master-Yoda

Master-Yoda is an Agentic AI system designed to help engineers generate self-appraisal summaries by
understanding their project work, evaluating them against role-specific outcomes, and producing
impact summaries + ratings.

The system uses multi-agent orchestration, MCP (Model Context Protocol) for controlled tool access,
AI-driven conversations, and structured evaluation workflows to simulate a performance reviewer.
